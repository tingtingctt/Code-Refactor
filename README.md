The source code from the original webpage was A MESS, full of redundant and unorganized codes and links.
In order for an experienced developer to further optimize the codings, I have cleaned up and arranged the code to my best ability to increase readability.
I have edited some codes that have obviously violated web accessibility codes.

<bold> Scope of work: <bold>

"General":
Re-formatted the html code with logical indentation and line breaks to facilitate readability.
Added comments to indicate content/function of each section.

"Head" section:
Re-organized the external links according to different types: Meta data, Title, SEO, Stylesheet, Other.
Moved external javascript links from "Head" section to the end of the "body" section.
Moved internal CSS codes to a separate .css file.
Edited "title" tag to optimize search engine results.

"Body" section:
For "non-profit disclaimer", "h1" tag is changed to "h2" to follow a logical semantic structure.
For "category of merchandise", "h2" tags are changed to "h3" to follow a logical semantic structure.
For "individual merchandise name", "h2" tags are changed to "h4" to follow a logical semantic structure.
On line 186, image alt text was edited because it was way too long, as long as an article...
On line 278, a missing image alt text was added to improve web accessibility.
On line 420, a duplicate link to Facebook was deleted, and a short instructional text was added to eliminate confusion and improve web accessibility.

"Script" section:
Moved all internal javascript codes to the end of the body. However, I would recommend moving these codes to a separate .js file.


P.S. There has been a confusion that I still cannot find out why: after I copied and pasted the source code, the little icons of "shopping cart", "minimized navigation bar", "add to shopping cart", and "Facebook logo", etc., could no longer show appropriately...
