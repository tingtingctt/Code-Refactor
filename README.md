The source code from the original webpage was A MESS, full of redundant and unorganized codes and links.
In order for an experienced developer to further optimize the codings, I have cleaned up and arranged the code to my best ability to increase readability.
I have edited some codes that have obviously violated web accessibility codes.

--Scope of work:

<General>
Re-formatted the html code with logical indentation and line breaks to facilitate readability.
Added comments to indicate content/function of each section.

<Head>
Re-organized the external links according to different types: Meta data, Title, SEO, Stylesheet, Other.
Moved external javascript links to the end of the body.
Moved internal CSS codes to a separate .css file.
Editted <title> to optimize search engine results.

<Body>
For "non-profit disclaimer", <h1> tag is changed to <h2> to follow a logical semantic structure.
For "category of merchandise", <h2> tags are changed to <h3> to follow a logical semantic structure.
For "individual merchandise name", <h2> tags are changed to <h4> to follow a logical semantic structure.
Deleted duplicate </p> closing tag.

<Script>
Moved all internal javascript codes to the end of the body. However, I would recommend moving these codes to a separate .js file.
